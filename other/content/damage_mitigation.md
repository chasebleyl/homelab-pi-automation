# Damage Mitigation

## Overview

Damage Mitigation is a percentage value that reduces all incoming damage of any type by a set amount.

All damage types benefit from this reduction except True Damage. The mechanic applies universally to any hero but proves especially valuable for defensive-focused characters.

## Key Characteristics

- **Universal Application**: While usable by any hero class, it's exceptionally useful on Tanks, Bruisers, and anyone that can take advantage of a larger health pool
- **Application Order**: Applied *before* Armor calculations
- **Execute Immunity**: Executes ignore Damage Mitigation entirely
