https://predecessor.wiki.gg/wiki/Health

## Overview

Health is a base statistic in Predecessor and serves as the main resource in which all entities in Predecessor function under. Every hero, jungle minion, tower, and objective possesses a health pool. When a unit's health reaches 0, death occurs.

## Health Restoration

Health can be restored through multiple mechanics:
- Health Regen
- Healing effects
- Lifesteal
- Omnivamp

## Maximum Health

Each champion begins with base health that increases per level. Maximum health equals base health plus bonus health, representing the largest value that health can be restored to, not counting shields.

## Health Bar Display

Heroes have health bars divided into sections, where each section represents 250 health. Each complete section always equals exactly 250 HP. The rightmost section may display a smaller value if remaining health doesn't complete a full 250 HP section.

### Minion and Monster Bars

Minion and monster health bars lack sections but turn red whenever they can be Executed by a Basic Attack. Structures and Bosses display large health bars at the top of the HUD showing exact health values.

### Execute Threshold Note

Certain effects bypass standard execute thresholds, including Muriel's passive and magical damage from Prophecy.

## Scaling Effects

Effects may scale off percentages or ratios of:
- Current HP
- Missing HP
- Maximum HP
- Bonus HP
