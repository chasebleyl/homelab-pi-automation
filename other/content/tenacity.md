# Tenacity
https://predecessor.wiki.gg/wiki/Tenacity

## Overview

Tenacity reduces the duration of many crowd control effects by a percentage equal to the amount of the player's Tenacity.

The stat has a maximum cap of 60%, meaning crowd control effects cannot be reduced beyond 60% of their original duration. However, Tenacity can become negative through certain effects.

## Key Mechanics

**Example Calculation:**
A player with 20% Tenacity hit by a 1-second stun would experience a reduced duration of 0.8 seconds (20% reduction applied).

**Exceptions:**
Tenacity has no effect on Knock ups and Suppression according to the Status Effects documentation.

**Negative Tenacity:**
Flux Matrix's passive ability, Unstable Shackles, reduces nearby enemy Tenacity by 20%. This can push a player to -20% Tenacity, effectively extending crowd control duration by 20%.
