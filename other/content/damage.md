## Overview

The Damage statistic in Predecessor consists of three distinct types: Physical Damage, Magical Damage, and True Damage.

## Physical Damage

Physical Damage is dealt by all Basic Attacks, with GRIM.exe and Muriel being notable exceptions due to their passives. This damage type is:

- **Reduced by:** Physical Armor
- **Amplified by:** Physical Power and Physical Penetration

## Magical Damage

Magical Damage is the primary damage type for most abilities. It is:

- **Mitigated by:** Magical Armor
- **Increased by:** Magical Power and Magical Penetration

## True Damage

Also known as Pure Damage, this type bypasses armor and flat mitigation, directly affecting an enemy's health or shield pool. Key characteristics include:

- Typically unaffected by power scaling
- Can be influenced by specific modifiers (e.g., Kallari's Death Mark increases damage based on target's missing health)
- Some abilities like Hunt's True Damage do not scale at all
