## Overview

There are two types of Power in Predecessor, Physical and Magical. These stats enhance basic attack values and ability effectiveness depending on their scaling type.

## Physical Power

Physical Power increases all hero basic attack damage and abilities with physical scaling (indicated by orange text and a specific icon). The damage multiplier grows proportionally with the percentage scaling of the ability.

### Calculation Example

For an ability with 155 base damage and +80% physical scaling with 440 physical power:
- Formula: (80% × 440) + 155 = **507 total damage**

Physical power can be obtained from items in flat amounts or through percentage increases via passive effects like Resolution's Potent Font.

## Magical Power

This stat boosts ability damage for many heroes. Similar to physical scaling, damage increases proportionally with the ability's percentage scaling coefficient.

### Calculation Example

For an ability with 370 base damage and +220% magical scaling with 350 magical power:
- Formula: (220% × 350) + 370 = **1,140 total damage**

## Important Exceptions

- **Rampage's Boulder Throw**: Uses physical scaling (+80%) but deals magical damage
- **Wraith's Knock, Knock!**: Deals physical damage but scales with both physical (+120%) and magical power (+75%)
