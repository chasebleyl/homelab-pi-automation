## Overview

Unstoppable is a pseudo-buff that is persistent on several abilities in Predecessor. Unstoppable negates any incoming forms of Crowd Control.

Any ability landing while Unstoppable is active becomes completely negated. Notably, this effect blocks only the crowd control component of an ability, not its damage.

## Abilities with Unstoppable

The following champion abilities grant this effect:

- Drongo's Shrapnel Cannon
- Khaimera's Invigorate
- Grim.exe's Energy Shield
- Steel's Shield Slam
- Muriel's Reversal of Fortune (once cast and during flight)
- Revenant's Reckoning (removes any applied crowd control upon projectile connection)
- Zarus' Coliseum

## Items with Unstoppable

Two items provide this effect:

- **Legacy** - grants Unstoppable via the Tenacious Bravery passive
- **Truesilver Bracelet** - grants Unstoppable via the Reprisal passive

## Key Mechanic

Additionally, unstoppable will *only* block the crowd control effect of an ability, and *not* the damage.

This means players still take damage from abilities while protected by Unstoppable; only the debilitating effects are prevented.
