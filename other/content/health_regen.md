# Health Regen
https://predecessor.wiki.gg/wiki/Health_Regen

## Definition

Health Regen (also referred to as HPS, HP5, or HPR) is the rate at which a player's Health naturally restores itself in and out of combat.

This mechanic can be enhanced through:
- Purchasing items with Health Regen stats
- Leveling up a Hero
- Gaining buffs with the associated stat

## Key Distinctions

Health Regen differs from healing. The former represents passive restoration, while the latter is active recovery. For example, items like Raiment of Renewal boost Health Regen, whereas Tranquility provides burst healing.

## Stat Interactions

Health Regen is affected by increased healing stats from items such as Void Helm and Draconum, but **not** by Heal & Shield Power bonuses.
