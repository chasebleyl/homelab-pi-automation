# Critical Strike Chance
https://predecessor.wiki.gg/wiki/Critical_Strike_Chance

## Overview

Critical Strike Chance is the stat that determines how often your attacks will deal extra damage. The baseline damage modifier sits at 165%, with one notable exception: Revenant begins at 145% but can reach up to 170% by leveling Hellfire Rounds.

## Key Mechanics

- **Application**: Only affects Basic Attacks and applies before armor calculations
- **Maximum Cap**: Cannot exceed 100% chance; purchasing items that would push past this threshold provides no additional benefit
- **Randomness**: Critical Strike Chance is purely random
- **Damage Boost**: The item Imperator provides a passive ability called Precision that increases all critical strike damage by 25%
