## Overview

Status Effects are conditions affecting Heroes with positive or negative consequences. These range from movement speed alterations to healing modifications, and even aerial displacement. Critically, debilitating effects are classified as Crowd Control (CC), divided into Soft and Hard variants.

## Negative Status Effects

### Soft Crowd Control

- **Slow**: Reduces Movement Speed; can be Cleansed, Immuned, and Mitigated
- **Blind**: Cascades the player's screen in black, negating vision; can be Cleansed and Mitigated
- **Silence**: Disables casting of Abilities, Consumables, Hunt, and Blink; can be Cleansed and Mitigated

### Hard Crowd Control

- **Root**: Halts all movement and negates movement abilities/blink; can be Cleansed and Mitigated
- **Tethered**: Locks movement to tether area, disabling movement abilities and blinks; can be Cleansed and Mitigated
- **Stun**: Halts all inputs and actions until duration ends; can be Cleansed, Immuned, and Mitigated
- **Knock Up**: Similar to Stun but launches the Hero airborne; can be Cleansed and Mitigated
- **Suppression**: Functions like Stun but duration cannot be reduced in any way after application, including Tenacity; can only be Cleansed

### Mitigation Methods

CC can be negated through Unstoppable effects built into hero abilities, CC Immunity from item passives, or Cleanse abilities with long cooldowns.

### Negative Debuffs

- **Blight**: Reduces all healing and Health Regen by 40%; does not stack with other Blight sources
- **Damage Over Time (DoT)**: Deals repeating damage instances

## Positive Status Effects

### Buffs

- **Movement Speed Boosts**: Increase Movement Speed by percentage or flat amount for set duration
- **Shielding**: Provides temporary Health (white bar segment); ignores Armor; lasts until broken or expires
- **CC Immunity**: Grants complete immunity to all Crowd Control forms during active duration
- **Spell Shielding**: Grants single-instance immunity to next damage source

### Pseudo-buffs

- **Unstoppable**: Negates all Crowd Control for specified duration
