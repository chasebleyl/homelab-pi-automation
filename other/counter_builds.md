# Counter Build Recommendations

---

**Mourn** (Transference, Tainted Scepter)
> Built: Lifecore & Unbroken Will
> Consider: **Frosted Lure** and **Dynamo**

- Frosted Lure offers anti-burst by slowing Zinx based on proximity and physical armor to offset Zinx's attack speed
- Dynamo amplifies Drongo's burst damage with 10% damage amp, which scales with Mourn's Contagion (reduces all armor on application)

---

**Drongo** (Lightning Hawk, Vanquisher)
> Built: Terminus & Scattershot
> Consider: **Nuclear Rounds** and **Mesmer** or **Imperator**

- Zinx/Phase want to sustain (attack speed meta) — Drongo should focus on burst
- Lifesteal needs sustained fighting to add value
- Nuclear Rounds adds attack speed, crit, and haste while increasing ability damage for bursts
- Mesmer 4th if needing spell shield & HP to deal with collapse from opponents
- Imperator 4th if duo regains lane priority and can be more aggressive

---

**Howie** (Combustion, Tainted Scepter)
> Built: Wraith Leggings & Noxia
> Consider: **Spellbreaker** and **Magnify**

- Spellbreaker adds magical armor & spell shield to counter Gadget's oppressive poke
- Magnify adds omnivamp & haste to kit-dump Gadget and threaten back

---

**Kallari** (Manta Scythe, Vanquisher)
> Built: Imperator & Necrosis
> Consider: **Mesmer** then normal build

- Mesmer gets max HP and spell shield to block next ability, improving survivability and giving crit time to execute
- Otherwise build aligns well

---

**Shinbi** (Megacosm, Tainted Scepter)
> Built: Wraith Leggings & Overseer
> Consider: **Spellbreaker** and **Giant's Ring** or **Magnify**

- Spellbreaker addresses magical burst damage in team fights, plus grants magical power while shield is active
- Giant's Ring 4th if overall damage mitigation & anti-burst is needed
- Magnify 4th if fights stay isolated (not getting ganked, no large group fights) for sustain and max HP
