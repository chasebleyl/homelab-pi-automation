**Short answer:**
👉 **Zinx DPS ADC is a *sustain* ADC, not a burst ADC.**

---

## Why Zinx DPS = Sustain

When you build **ADC Zinx around Cursed Ring + her passive**, her damage profile shifts very clearly into **sustained damage over time**, even though she *casts spells*.

### Key Reasons

**1. Damage ramps, not spikes**

* Zinx’s **passive applies repeated magical DoT**.
* **Cursed Ring** rewards *continuous uptime* rather than short trades.
* Damage **accumulates over several seconds**, instead of front-loading.

**2. Fight pattern = extended uptime**

* Zinx DPS wants to:

  * Stay in range
  * Continuously apply autos/spells
  * Let passive + ring ticks stack value
* This is the textbook definition of **sustain DPS**, even though it’s magical.

**3. Cooldown + uptime synergy**

* Zinx thrives when she can **keep effects rolling**, not dump cooldowns and disengage.
* If forced into short trades, her value drops significantly compared to true burst mages or burst ADCs.

## Why She Is *Not* Burst (Even Though She’s a Caster)

Burst ADCs:

* Do most of their damage in **1–2 seconds**
* Spike when abilities connect
* Are happy disengaging immediately

Zinx DPS:

* Needs **multiple ticks** of passive + Cursed Ring
* Damage profile **improves the longer the fight goes**
* Loses value if fights end quickly

Even if her abilities feel impactful, **they are enablers**, not the damage endpoint.

## Correct Tagging (Aligned With Your System)

For **Zinx DPS ADC**:

* **Primary:** `sustained_damage`
* **Secondary:** `on_hit` (magical / DoT flavor)
* **Optional:** `scaling`, `tempo`

❌ Do **not** tag as:

* `burst_damage`
* `high_variance`

---

## Important Clarifier (Very Common Confusion)

> **“Ability-based ≠ Burst”**

Zinx proves this:

* Ability *frequency* + uptime = sustain
* Ability *front-loading* = burst

Zinx DPS uses abilities to **maintain damage**, not to end fights instantly.

---

### Bottom line

**Zinx DPS ADC is a sustain ADC with magical DoT characteristics.**
She should be evaluated, itemized against, and countered the same way you’d handle any other **extended-fight carry**, not a burst threat.

If you want, I can:

* Compare **Zinx DPS vs Sparrow / TwinBlast** in fight profiles
* Show **what counters sustain Zinx** item-wise
* Help tag **ADC Zinx vs Mage Zinx** cleanly in your system
