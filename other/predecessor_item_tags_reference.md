# Predecessor Item Tag Reference (1v1, Role-Agnostic)

Concise tag taxonomy for itemization logic.  

## Tag Set

- burst_damage — High upfront damage that decides short (1–3s) trade windows.
- sustained_damage — Damage output that remains strong over extended (5–10s+) fights.
- damage_amplification — Effects that increase damage taken or dealt (%, exposure, vulnerability).
- on_hit — Damage or effects that trigger on basic attacks.
- pct_max_hp_damage — Damage based on the target’s maximum health; strong vs tanks.
- anti_heal — Reduces or negates enemy healing, regen, lifesteal, or omnivamp.
- anti_burst — Mitigation against short-window kill pressure (shields, DR, delayed damage).
- max_hp — Increases total health pool to survive burst and extend fights.
- physical_mitigation — Reduces incoming physical damage (armor or equivalent effects).
- magical_mitigation — Reduces incoming magical damage (magic resist or equivalent effects).
- sustain — Restores health during or after combat (healing, lifesteal, omnivamp, regen).
- ability_haste — Reduces ability cooldowns to increase spell frequency and tempo.
- tempo — Improves waveclear, mana economy, or cooldown flow to control recall and pressure.
- stickiness — Tools that help stay on a target (slows, gap-close, MS toward enemies).
- kite_tool — Tools that help disengage or maintain distance (slows, MS away, peel).
- tenacity — Reduces duration of crowd control effects.
- spellshield — Blocks or negates a key enemy ability or CC instance.
- scaling — Item power increases significantly with time, levels, or additional items.
- high_variance — High risk/high reward item; strong when ahead, weak when behind.
- dueling_power — Explicitly increases strength in isolated 1v1 combat scenarios.

**Usage note:**
Tags should be selected **before items**, treated as equal or higher priority than raw stats, and mapped to items only after the stat/tag package is finalized.
